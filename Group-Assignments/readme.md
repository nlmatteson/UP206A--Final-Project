## Title

Impact of BART's TOD Projects on housing accessibility and affordability

## Introduction and Research Question
	
For our project, we hope to analyze how Bay Area Rapid Transit’s (BART) completed Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) projects have impacted the nearby communities, specifically considering the equity implications. We plan to research housing availability/affordability has changed since the projects completed.

## Why it is important
	
Transit Oriented Development has been appraised by government officials and planners as a means to accommodate increasing populations without sprawl. Seen as a sustainable development strategy, TOD projects have numerous benefits including; increase public transit ridership, revitalize neighborhoods, reduce traffic congestion and associated impacts of single occupancy vehicle dominated travel, increase housing supply, and encourage physical activity. Despite these benefits, TOD projects have also shown to induce gentrification which has significant equity implications. Those who are priced out of their neighborhoods are forced to leave while others who can afford to live in the newly renovated area reap the benefits. TOD projects can therefore be a vehicle for continued social stratification, or it can be a solution.
	
It is crucial for TOD projects to ensure the benefits of the project are equitable and improve the livelihoods of the entire community. This topic is important to our group because we, as planners in the making, want to make sure we are contributing to the communities we serve in a way which promotes equity. The planning profession has had a history of inequities. We do not want to be another generation who ignores disempowered communities. Equity is a main pillar of sustainability and is essential for climate change adaptation. The State of California has encouraged cities to build TOD projects, but they must be done carefully to ensure the outcomes are equitable.  

## Spatial and Temporal Scope
	
Our project area of focus is primarily in Hayward, California but will also include BART TOD projects in Alameda County. Since the project effects project hopes to look at are within the counties, lower level data specifications, like that at a zip-code level, will be required.

Since the project aims to map the change, temporal specification is important for the project. We plan to compare equity implications from 2010 (before many TOD projects were built) and 2019 (when many of the projects have been completed). We need to compare between these two time periods as well as between individual projects because we need to see what changed, how things changed, and which had more equitable results.

## Data

The following data sources are used for the project

**Data on TOD project locations in the BART System:** BART has published a list of completed TOD projects, all located on its transit stations. For this geospatial data available from BART will be used along with the 
Data is currently available [here in KMZ format](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/BART_System_2020.kmz_.zip )

**Housing Data:** Housing data is available from the [American Community Survey Estimates for 2019. ](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Housing%20Value%20and%20Purchase%20Price%3ARenter%20Costs&g=0400000US06%248600000&tid=ACSDP5Y2019.DP04 )
This includes the financial characteristics of the housing, including its purchase price, rent costs, and other costs including utilities. 

**Population Data from American Community Survey:** Data on demographics and employment/income will be used along with housing data to assess housing accessibility. 

## Intended analysis and Visualizations

The project will establish housing affordability and accessibility indexes for periods before and after the TOD project(s) is completed. Affordability will be derived from information on housing costs, and rents. Accessibility will be calculated based on population characteristics including demographics, and income.

Primary product of the project is a visualization of changes to the affordability and accessibility indexes in the pre and post-project periods. Inclusion of neighboring regions in the project should enable us to track any patterns of gentrification due to the BART TOP Projects. 

## Conclusion

California’s deep housing crisis clears the way for TOD projects along key corridors. However these projects often increase land values in neighborhoods, forcing older residents out of their homes, only to exacerbate the issue of commute and access to transit. In this project, we hope to find some evidence for TOD-related gentrification in the form of changes to affordability and accessibility of housing around the project areas.
