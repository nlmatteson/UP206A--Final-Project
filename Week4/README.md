### Link to Proposal: https://github.com/nlmatteson/UP206A--Final-Project/tree/main/Group-Assignments 
## Roles
**Nicole**: Looking into census data to determine which variables would be useful, working on analyzing the data, strategizing with Chaithra.
**Chaithra**: Looking into census data to determine which variables would be useful, working on analyzing the data, strategizing with Nicole.
We are working together to finalize the methods and search for data. We will allocate work before we start the actual analysis. 
## Status Update
We feel like our project is in a good place. This week, we are finalizing our methods and the data that will drive the rest of our project. 
Right now we are looking into census data that can provide insight for how housing access has changed as a result of TOD projects. We are working to operationalize housing access and affordability, which is the core of the analysis.  
We are also working on figuring out how to compare our project area with a control area so that we can show our analysis is significant enough to support our hypothesis. Possibility: Take a non-TOD project as the control area, or compare it to the county average. 
We discussed other aspects of our project that we should include, namely providing context for the area of focus and creating charts as well as maps. We just need to have all our data finalized so that we can distribute tasks and get a more concrete strategy for what we want our project to look like. Going great so far!
## Data Update
We will use the following datasets. Data is downloaded at census tract level for Alameda County
* 2019 and 2011 ethnicity data - ACS - downloaded and cleaned.
* Data set with ToD stops - from gis.data.ca.gov - downloaded, need to isolate relevant stops. 
* 2019 and 2011 median income data - ACS - yet to download.
* 2019 and 2011 housing data - ACS - gross rent as a percentage of household income. Need to ensure suitability. 
## Concerns
Minor concerns:
1. The quarter system is moving so fast!

Major concerns:
1. Does our method make sense?
2. Will we be able to prove our findings are significant?
 
 
Include the following sections:
Project title and link to proposal
Roles (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
